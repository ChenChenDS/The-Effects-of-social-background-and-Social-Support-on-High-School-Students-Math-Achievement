# The Effects of social backgroun and Social Support on High School Students Math Achievement
This is a grouped project analysis the effects of students social background and social support on high school students math achievement. We do the analysis in many aspects(gender, native language, school background, mother/father education levels, social economic status) and we finally build a linear model to find out the factors have the higher influence. 

### Motivation
A strong mathematical background is important for admission to many college majors, to entry into most professional and technical occupations as well.
Mathematics as the most basic pillar of STEM fields is associated with the global competitiveness and economic leadership of a country. 
High school students’ math achievement is a strong indicator of students‘ earnings around 10 years later. Among individuals who have the same level of education, those who take more math courses, especially advanced ones in high school, are more likely to obtain a job, and have higher salaries on average (James, 2013).
